//Your new custom sass mixins belong here -- which output some css values via the `@include` syntax keyword
//This is where the custom theme overrides or extends existing Backbase mixins
//It is not recommended to directly override Bootstrap mixins.
//Please refer to the generated sassdocs for reusable mixins API documentations

/// Set flexbox to element
@mixin flex {
  // write the css here
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: flex;
}
